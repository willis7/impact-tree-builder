# Specification Quality Checklist: Drag-and-Drop Interactions for Node and Relationship Creation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 15, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**All clarifications resolved:**

- **FR-014**: âœ… Resolved - System will maintain three parallel interaction methods (drag-and-drop, click-based workflows, and keyboard shortcuts) for accessibility and user preference

All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for implementation.
