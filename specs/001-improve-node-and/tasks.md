# Tasks: Drag-and-Drop Interactions for Node and Relationship Creation

**Feature Branch**: `001-improve-node-and`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-improve-node-and/`  
**Prerequisites**: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/drag-state.ts, quickstart.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (enhances same workflow)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Can start in parallel with US1/US2 if staffed
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 3 completion (enhances same workflow)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Can start in parallel with other stories if staffed
- **Auto-Pan & Keyboard (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 and US3 completion (applies to both workflows)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Requires User Story 1 complete - Enhances same node creation workflow
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Requires User Story 3 complete - Enhances same relationship workflow
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Applies visual polish to all stories

### Within Each User Story

**TDD Workflow** (Constitution Principle I):

1. **Red Phase**: Write tests FIRST, verify they FAIL
2. **Green Phase**: Implement code to make tests PASS
3. **Refactor Phase**: Clean up code while keeping tests passing

**Task Order Within Story**:

1. Tests before implementation (all test tasks marked with story label)
2. Custom hooks before components (hooks are reusable infrastructure)
3. Child components before parent components (bottom-up integration)
4. Core functionality before polish (visual feedback, animations)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:

- Tasks T001-T007 can all run in parallel (independent file creation/installation)

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2)**:

- Tasks T008-T012 (utility functions) can run in parallel
- Tasks T013-T014 (DndContext setup) must run after T008-T012

**User Story 1 Tests (Phase 3)**:

- Tasks T016-T025 can all run in parallel (different test files)

**User Story 3 Tests (Phase 5)**:

- Tasks T051-T062 can all run in parallel (different test files)

**User Story 5 Implementation (Phase 7)**:

- Tasks T092-T095 (cursor styles) can run in parallel (different components)

**Keyboard Shortcuts (Phase 8)**:

- Tasks T109-T118 (key handlers) can run in parallel (all in same component, different functions)

**Documentation (Phase 9)**:

- Tasks T122-T127 (JSDoc and README) can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all test files for User Story 1 together:
Task T016-T019: "Unit tests for useDragNode hook" ‚Üí src/hooks/__tests__/useDragNode.test.ts
Task T020: "Drag initiation test" ‚Üí src/components/__tests__/Sidebar.test.tsx
Task T021-T022: "Drop handling tests" ‚Üí src/components/__tests__/ImpactCanvas.test.tsx
Task T023-T025: "Integration tests" ‚Üí src/components/__tests__/ImpactTreeApp.test.tsx
```

All four test files can be written simultaneously by different developers.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only)

**Minimal Viable Product**: Node drag-and-drop with auto-deselect

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T015) ‚Üê CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T042)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T043-T050)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test node drag-and-drop independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready (core value delivered)

**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours  
**Value Delivered**: Primary user complaint resolved (SC-001: node creation < 3 seconds)

### Incremental Delivery

**Iteration 1: Node Creation** (P1 Priority)

- Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 + User Story 2
- Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
- Time: 10-12 hours

**Iteration 2: Relationship Creation** (P2 Priority)

- User Story 3 + User Story 4
- Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
- Time: 8-10 hours

**Iteration 3: Visual Polish** (P3 Priority)

- User Story 5
- Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
- Time: 4-5 hours

**Iteration 4: Accessibility & Performance** (Cross-Cutting)

- Phase 8: Auto-Pan + Keyboard Shortcuts
- Test all workflows ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
- Time: 6-8 hours

**Iteration 5: Finalization**

- Phase 9: Documentation + Testing + Validation
- Time: 2-3 hours

**Total Estimated Time**: 30-38 hours

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational phase complete):

**Developer A**: User Story 1 + 2 (Node drag-and-drop) ‚Üí 10-12 hours  
**Developer B**: User Story 3 + 4 (Relationship drag-and-drop) ‚Üí 8-10 hours  
**Developer C**: User Story 5 (Visual feedback) + Phase 8 (Auto-pan/Keyboard) ‚Üí 10-13 hours

All three can work in parallel after Phase 2, then merge and complete Phase 9 together.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD Workflow**: All test tasks MUST fail before implementation tasks
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story should be independently testable
- **Checkpoints**: Validate story works independently before moving to next priority
- **Constitution Compliance**: All tasks align with 7 constitutional principles
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard shortcuts (FR-017) ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Target 60fps animations, 100ms feedback latency (SC-005, SC-006)
- **Test Coverage**: 40+ new tests planned, all 111 existing tests must continue passing
